adapt-webObject
===================

A simple Adapt component for containing html content.

Installation
------------

First, be sure to install the Adapt Framework v2.0, then download the webObject component from:-

		https://github.com/ndeighan/adapt-webObject

Copy to the src/components folder of the framework.

Usage
-----
Once in place, the component can be used to create a container for html, within your content.

For example JSON format, see [example.json](https://github.com/ndeighan/adapt-webObject/example.json)

Note: for use with the Trickle extension, the adapt-webObject is listening for the variable triggerVar to change.
Include a simple piece of javascript at the end of your html5 piece that sets "parent.triggerVar = 1;"
